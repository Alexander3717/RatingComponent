## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Select and submit a number rating
-   See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

-   SASS features
-   Vanilla JavaScript
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

If you need a circle element to keep its shape when it shrinks (normally it deforms to an ellipse), instead of doing this:

```css
.circle {
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```

you can omit the height (or width) and use the `aspect-ratio` property:

```css
.circle {
    width: 40px;
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```

And here‚Äôs a slightly embarrassing one: I use VS Code, and there is this extension called Prettier, which automatically formats your code. Well ‚Äî turns out it doesn't unless you enable "format on save" in VS Code settings and set Prettier as the default formatter. I spent so much time indenting and aligning stuff thinking Prettier is running, just doing something different than I thought. Nope, it was turned off. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Continued development

I need to focus more on proper code organization in future projects. This was a small challenge but still there were a lot of annoying differences between the mobile and tablet/desktop layout. And I easily got lost in them because I didn't take the time to set up some useful variables and mixins in the beginning. When "cleaning" the code at the end (because it was basically unmaintainable), I also realized that sometimes _not_ nesting CSS selectors might be better, even if you are using SASS.
